# Noted

Noted is a web application meant to help work professionals manage and complete projects in a more efficient manner.

## Live Demo
Play around with the [live demo here](jschack94.github.io/noted-frontend/). Go ahead and sign up as a new user, and play around with creating new tasks and projects!

## Installing Locally

1. Follow on the links for both the [frontend](https://github.com/jschack94/Noted-Backend) and [backend](https://github.com/jschack94/Noted-frontend).
2. Clone both of them down into separate folders on your computer.
3. In the command line, `cd` into the backend folder and run `bundle install`.
4. Run `rails s` to start your backend server. It should run on `localhost:3000`.
5. Open another tab in your command line, `cd` into the frontend folder and run `npm install`.
6. Run `npm start` to start your frontend server. If you are prompted to run the server on a different port than your backend, type `y`. Your frontend server should run on `localhost:3001`.

After you run `npm start`, a tab in your browser should open automatically.
